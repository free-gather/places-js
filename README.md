PlacesJS is a framework based on Web Components for building interative UIs and managing state. 

Currently the framework is under active development and the source code is located [here](https://github.com/free-gather/DMVBoardGames/tree/main/src/framework). In the future, the framework source code will be in this repo and be deployed as an
npm package.

Here are some notes about the patterns the framework uses.

## State management

In order to modify state, PlacesJS, uses an adaptation of the Flux pattern and reducers.
